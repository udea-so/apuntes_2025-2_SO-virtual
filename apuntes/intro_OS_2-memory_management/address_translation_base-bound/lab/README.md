# Lab

## Intro

In this lab, weâ€™ll use a simulator, `mem_relocation.py` to show how address translations work in a system with base and bounds registers.

**Note**: The lab assumes a slightly different layout as opposed to what was introduced earlier. Instead of the heap and stack on opposing sides of memory, the code, stack, and heap are all contiguous.

Memory can only grow toward higher areas of the address space.

The bounds register in the above image is **7KB**, which represents the end of the address space. An exception would be raised if an address exceeds the limit.

**Run simulation**

```
python3 mem_relocation.py 1

Base and Boards Information
----------------------------
Base: 0x0003082 (decimal: 12418)
Limit: 472

Virtual Address Trace:
  * 0x01a9 (decimal: 425)
  * 0x0101 (decimal: 257)
  * 0x021d (decimal: 541)
  * 0x0182 (decimal: 386)
  * 0x0331 (decimal: 817)
```

The output should be:

```
Base and Boards Information
----------------------------
Base: 0x0003082 (decimal: 12418)

Virtual Address Trace:
* 0x01a9 (decimal: 425)
* 0x0101 (decimal: 257)
* 0x021d (decimal: 541)
* 0x0182 (decimal: 386)
* 0x0331 (decimal: 817)
```

The simulation creates a set of virtual address spaces. You will be asked questions to determine if the address is out of bounds or what its base address is.
* `0x01a9` - valid address because it is less than the limit. The base address would become `0x0000322b`.
* `0x0101` - valid address because it is less than the limit. The base address would become `0x00003183`.
* `0x021d` - out-of-bounds address because it exceeds the limit.
* `0x0182` - valid address because it is less than the limit. The base address would become `0x00003204`.
* `0x0331`- out-of-bounds address because it exceeds the limit.

Calculations are performed using then converting them to hexadecimal. For the address `0x01a9`, the decimal value is `425` which is less than the limit of `472`. Add this decimal value with that of the base:

```
12418 + 425 = 12843
```

Take `12843` and convert it to hexadecimal. This gives you the final address of `0x0000322b`.
