# Summary

We have discussed two basic approaches to sheduling:
* Minimize the turnaround time by running the shortest remaining job first.
* Minimize response time by alternating between all of the jobs.

These two approaches are at odds with one another. That means a trade-off must be made. Finally, we looked at how to schedule jobs when working with I/O.
